## Conclusion
Along this App, i successfully built a todo list app that allows a user to add new tasks, mark a task as completed and delete old ones. We also discussed the importance of accounting for empty states when designing an application, then proceeded to talk about a potential problem when using the :empty selector and how to fix it.
Finally, discussed persisting the application state to the browserâ€™s localStorage and how to get around its limitations using JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.
